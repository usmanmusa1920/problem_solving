# Simulation is when you code up all the laws of physics, into a programm, and run that programm to try and create what happened when planet run around stars, or what happend when galaxies collide, or maybe even what happend if star get too close to black hole.

# Running a simulation is what is called high performance computing.

# Simulation is like a movie of an object evolving, which will reduce the time for solving big problem
