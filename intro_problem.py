    INTRODUCTION TO PROBLEM SOLVING
    
    Welcome to problem solving chapter, where we will be featuring how to solve problem matimatically, physics complex problem equation modelizing them into one chuck of well organise snippet of code by the use of well known scientific programming language (python programming language). We wll break down complicated phenomena in physics and possibly quantum mechanics and other mathematical problem by the use of computational method. Different equations can easily equiped with python. First let us know something about problem solving.
    
    Problem-solving is applied in many areas, sometimes with different viewpoints, and with different terminologies. As an example, it is a mental process in psychology and a computerized process in computer science. It is regarded the most complex of all intellectual functions. Problem solving has been defined as a higher-order cognitive requiring the modulation and control of more routine or fundamental skills. Problem solving has two major domains: mathematical problem solving and personal problem solving where, in the second, some difficulty or barrier is encountered. Further problem solving occurs when moving from a given state to a desired goal state is needed for either living organisms or an artificial intelligent system.
    
    While problem solving accompanies the beginning of human evolution and the history of mathematics, the nature of human problem-solving processes and methods has been studied by psychologists over the past hundred years. Methods of studying problem solving include introspection, behaviorism, simulation, computer modeling, and experiment. Social psychologists have recently distinguished between independent and interdependent problem-solving. Problems occur in two different types, ill-defined and well-defined from which appropriate solutions are to be made.
    
    Problem solving is used in engineering when products or processes fail, so corrective action can be taken to prevent further failures. It can also be applied to a product or process prior to an actual fail event, i.e., when a potential problem can be predicted and analyzed, and mitigation applied so the problem never actually occurs. Techniques such as Failure Mode Effects Analysis can be used to proactively reduce the likelihood of problems occurring.
    
    We will go into simulation also as well:
      # Simulation is when you code up all the laws of physics, into a programm, and run that programm to try and create what happened when planet run around stars, or what happend when galaxies collide, or maybe even what happend if star get too close to black hole.

      # Running a simulation is what is called high performance computing.

      # Simulation is like a movie of an object evolving, which will reduce the time for solving big problem

    
        Problem: To print the 13 times table from 1 x 13 to 12 x 13
        Algorithm: 
        1 	FOR z = 1 to 12
        2 	Print 13 x z
        3 	END FOR
        
        for num in range(1, 14):
          print("13 *", num, "=", 13*num)
